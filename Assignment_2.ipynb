        "\n",
        "Your organization wants to implement a Notification System to inform employees about updates, events, or alerts. Notifications can be sent through various channels, such as email, SMS, and push notifications. Each channel has a different implementation, but all follow a common interface.\n",
        "The system should allow selecting the notification type dynamically and ensure that it can be extended in the future without modifying the existing code.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "Task Description:\n",
        "You are required to implement a Notification System with the following functionality:\n",
        "1.\tAbstraction: Define a common contract for sending notifications through different channels.\n",
        "2.\tInheritance: Implement specific notification types inheriting from the base class.\n",
        "3.\tDynamic Selection: The system should allow selecting a notification type (email, SMS, or push notification) at runtime and send messages accordingly.\n",
        "________________________________________\n",
        "Scenario:\n",
        "Imagine a situation where:\n",
        "1.\tNew Policy Announcement: HR needs to notify employees about a new policy update.\n",
        "2.\tEvent Reminder: The Events team wants to send a reminder for an upcoming office event.\n",
        "3.\tSystem Alert: IT wants to notify employees about a scheduled server downtime.\n",
        "Each of these notifications can be sent through email, SMS, or push notifications depending on the employee's preferences.\n"
